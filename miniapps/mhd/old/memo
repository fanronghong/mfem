imMHDp.cpp: this version is identical to exMHDp but use J as an auxilary variable (preparing for the implicit time stepping)

imMHDpTdofs.cpp: identical to exMHDp but use J as an auxilary varible and use true dofs in BlockVector instead dofs

mini: a minimal case to demonstrate the failure of new PetscParVector

amrTest: a simplified test to verify the dynamic amr interface in an implicit scheme (using tdofs as the block vector)

assembleMatrix: test matrices and output in matlab format
