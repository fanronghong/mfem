ex10: solve a time-dependent nonlinear elasticity
it builds the Jacobian matrix
it uses Newtion

check nonlinear form:
HyperelasticNLFIntegrator

basic structure:
ode_solver->HyperelasticOperator->newton_solver(reduced_oper)->j_solver(Jacobian)

===MODEL===
see http://mfem.github.io/doxygen/html/classmfem_1_1NeoHookeanModel.html

===SOLVER===
there is a sundial example 10 (using kinsol)/
it does not hurt to see....
it is not using JFNK through.

where the Jacobian is used?? 
By default, it is used in newton solver (linalg/solver.cpp). That is why jsolver only needs preconditioner.


>>>>>>
ex1: solve -\Delta u=1
apply boundary condition, which could be a mass for us:
   if (mesh->bdr_attributes.Size())
   {
      Array<int> ess_bdr(mesh->bdr_attributes.Max());
      ess_bdr = 1;
      fespace->GetEssentialTrueDofs(ess_bdr, ess_tdof_list);
   }

check bilinear form:
a->AddDomainIntegrator(new DiffusionIntegrator(one));

this is useful (basic classes):

bilinear form (very helpful!)
http://mfem.org/bilininteg/

some thing I need:
CalcDivShape (probably not, unless we use some fancy space)
CalcDShape
CalcShape

There is already a wrapper to KINSOL. Will that be enough if we add our own preconditioner? Or it is better to implement our own. We probably cannot use the multigrid in the algorithm.

ex2 is a basic linear elasticity example: H1 or NURBS elements; How to add boundary as an extra degree of freedoms; 
ex5 is a saddle point problem: visit output (very easy)

H1_FECollection lin_coll(order-1, dim); 
should dim=1??: No, here is just define a scalar value

should read ex2 ex5 and ex10

>>>>>>
ex2.cpp
Do not know static condensation
this problem requires two boundary attibutes in the mesh (come with the grid generator)

This part is not clear (boundary condition)
   ess_bdr = 0;
   ess_bdr[0] = 1;
   fespace->GetEssentialTrueDofs(ess_bdr, ess_tdof_list);

I think the boundary condition may not be the same as it claims
